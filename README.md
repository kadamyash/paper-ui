### paper-ui

A free to use CSS Style Framework that is minimal, responsive &amp; customizable. Just download the CSS file &amp; write on the top of those styles. The visual style is a specific taste (mid-saturation, pencil-paper like visuals with some motion) I used this as my primary branding style for 2022.
